This program implements a sorted singly linked list in C++, ensuring elements are always stored in ascending order upon insertion. It supports insertion, removal, searching, and traversal while handling edge cases like empty or single-node lists. Catch2 test cases are included to verify correctness, list order, and safe pointer handling under various scenarios.
